# procare-media-downloader
Hack method to download all of your media from procare.

***INSTRUCTIONS BELOW***

Quick script I wrote to download all pictures and videos out of procare. To use, do the following:

1.) Copy the following string of text:

```javascript:var js = document.createElement('script');js.src = 'https://mas-tool.github.io/procare-media-downloader/index.js';document.querySelectorAll('head')[0].appendChild(js)```

2.) Open google chrome (might work with other browsers, but not really tested)

3.) Log into procare

4.) In the address bar, type the word "javascript" followed by a colon (:) like this:

5.) Paste the text you copied earlier so your address bar now looks like this:

6.) Hit ENTER

7.) Select the date range of pictures you want to extract and click "EXTRACT"

8.) When the website asks for permission to download multiple files, click "YES". These are your pictures and videos its trying to download.

This sounds *WAY* more complicated than it really is.
